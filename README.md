# Cybersecurity Fundamentals Portfolio

This repository contains a curated collection of cybersecurity analysis exercises
based on realistic scenarios. The focus is on **security reasoning, risk analysis,
incident investigation, and decision-making**, rather than tool-heavy or exploit-based work.

The activities reflect foundational skills expected from entry-level cybersecurity
and security operations roles.

## Contents

### Network Hardening Assessment  
Analysis of common network vulnerabilities and recommended hardening measures,
including strong authentication policies, firewall configuration, and access control
to reduce exposure and prevent breaches.

### Access Control and AAA Analysis  
Review of authentication, authorization, and accounting issues in a small business
environment, identifying excessive privileges and improper account lifecycle
management, with recommendations based on the principle of least privilege.

### Network Traffic Analysis  
Investigation of a DNS service disruption using packet analysis concepts. The activity
identifies DNS and ICMP behavior in tcpdump logs and determines the root cause of
service unavailability.

### Incident Response Using NIST CSF  
Analysis of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
(NIST CSF), covering Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover phases to improve
organizational resilience.

### SQL Query Filtering for Security Analysis  
Use of SQL filtering techniques to investigate security events such as failed login
attempts, suspicious access patterns, and department-based asset management. The
activity demonstrates practical use of `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `LIKE`, date, and time
filters in a security context.

### Risk Assessment and Prioritization  
Evaluation of common operational and cybersecurity risks within a financial
institution. Risks are scored based on likelihood and severity to support informed
prioritization and resource allocation.

### Data Leak Risk Assessment  
Analysis of an internal data leak caused by improper access controls. The activity
applies the principle of least privilege and references NIST SP 800-53 (AC-6) to
recommend control enhancements that reduce the likelihood of future data exposure.

## Purpose

This repository was created to demonstrate foundational knowledge in:

- Network security fundamentals  
- Incident analysis and response  
- Traffic analysis and troubleshooting  
- Risk assessment and prioritization  
- Access control and data protection  
- Applying security frameworks and standards in practical scenarios  

All content is intentionally concise, structured, and focused on **clear reasoning,
communication, and security decision-making**, suitable for a junior cybersecurity
portfolio.
