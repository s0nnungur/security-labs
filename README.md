# Cybersecurity Fundamentals Portfolio

This repository contains a small collection of security analysis exercises
focused on core cybersecurity and incident response concepts. 
The work is based on realistic scenarios and emphasizes analysis, detection,
and practical security thinking rather than tool-heavy implementations.

## Contents

### Network Hardening Assessment
Analysis of common network vulnerabilities and recommended hardening measures,
including strong authentication, firewall configuration, and access control.

### Access Control and AAA Analysis
Review of authentication, authorization, and accounting issues in a small
business environment, with recommendations based on least privilege and proper
account lifecycle management.

### Network Traffic Analysis
Investigation of a DNS outage using packet analysis concepts, identifying DNS
and ICMP behavior and determining the root cause of service unavailability.

### Incident Response Using NIST CSF
Analysis of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack using the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework, covering identification, protection, detection, response, and
recovery phases.

## Purpose

This repository was created to demonstrate foundational knowledge in:
- Network security
- Incident analysis and response
- Traffic analysis and troubleshooting
- Applying security frameworks in practical scenarios

All content is intentionally concise and focused on clear reasoning and
decision-making.
